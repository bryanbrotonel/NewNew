        <h2>Motive</h2>
        <p>New New is a platform where we shed light on new artists.</p>
        <p>The motive behind New New is to share new sounds with the world as music
          is one of the best gifts we can share with others.</p>
        <p>We believe that mainstream media only scratches the surface of the best
          sounds out there. There are plenty of sounds and artists that have yet to be discovered.</p>
        <p>From emecees, to artists, to producers, we got you covered.<br> These are the internet's hidden gems.</p>
